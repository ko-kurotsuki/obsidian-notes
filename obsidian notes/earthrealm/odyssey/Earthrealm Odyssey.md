### Session 1

Dr. Romanius has enslaved us

Dr Romaniusis a son of High Lord Sonnery

Robani is sending us on a secret mission to bring the diplomat lady ataxia to meet with another from Empress Koncosm to plot to overthrow the prince luchanns

We bury the orc baelon that romaiuns killed, recover our items then move north

There are 4 figures as we cross

1. A large scoripin
2. 2 a swarm of scarbs
3. A large shark fin

We are taking ataxia to the fallstaff manor, to attend a banquet. Apprently it has delicous food.

The toccota content is inhabited by golithes.

The first teifling is malthion

The second teifling is Ron

Ron betrayed sonnnry, but malthion stoppend him. For a reward, Ron’s decendents were made into a slave class, and malthions decendents were made into royaltay.

Ataxia is a memer of the royal family, and is considered a princess.

Ingred is a goliath that was raised by dwarves. Their family has a traditon of having the offspring fight and kill their parents then eat thier heart.

Fates most memrible kill was when his mom fought an owl bear for six hours straight, and fate put the last arrow into it. It was his first kill

We encounter a lightning charged sandworm called a carthinan wormling. It was a tough fight, and fate was downed and nearly killed (I took more then doule my hp, but we just ruled that I would go down and fail 2 death saving throughs.) dirimued was able to heal him with lay on hands, and we leveled up so we recovered to full hp and spell slots.

brinja picked up the Carthinion scale from the wormling

### Session 2

We walk through the dessert and come acros the dying sir sadore

Sadore is a knight of castora, and was hunting the great cathinging worm. He fought and wounded it, but he got mortally wounded aswell.

He gave diremuid the spark light sword, and asked him to carry on his misstion of defeating the Great worm.

We can distract enemies using meat, as shown by ingried.

  
The sand storm ended, so we can now walk at a normal pace through the dessert, and the land ahead is opened up to us.

We fought a sand shark, and it nearly killed diremuid, but he managed to servive thanks to the favor of lady castora. We got a sand sark fang from the courps

Fate’s patron messaged him and opened a patch of chaos realm that him and the party can use to rest outside of the elements(Lilthena’s sanctuary).

We tok a short

### Session 3

/we didnt do anything this time, we were going to start but it got cancelled I think/

### Session 4

When walking to the second area, we fought a and Elder stoneman,

After casting detect magic on the curse, Fate learned that the enslavement placed on them curse was created using Aamons power. Lilithena explains that the blood was made into gems that fit onto the dagger. Reterving more power means retreving more gems for us to use.

We also learn that is been 2 years since fate was first enslaved.

Checking the area, fate saw that there is a powerful magic to the far north, and smaller magics along the way. The magic signitures to the west is the weakest.

Tecknotep was one of the orignal followers of the forefather that was cursed. Acordding to tecknotep, the forefather puneshed the use of necromancy because the forefather created everyone to feed on later. He hated necromacy because it took his food from him. He also says there is no afterlife.

Before we were taken by the stoneman dragonborn Conrad Cosmic saved .

Luchianices is in paridisia is ruling over the new continent. The golith Empress is currently ruling gaia

### Session 5

Brinja’s brother studied under sonnery.

Her mom and and dad are neglectful af.

It seems that brinja has lost more memories then the rest of us, sonnery probably wanted to hide improtant info from us.

### Session 6

The T-rex used the acid to create 4 stone men, we faught them.

After crossing the river, we find the achnent stoneman, called lysander.

Lysander used to live here before the curse, but the forefather got him and his people. Now he is vengeful and wishs to curreput all of his people as was cursed

We fight bravely, but we get captured by him. We were forced into an illusion of our own memories

Derimud was forced to remember his past when he was sent to learn to study the sword. He feels sad about not being able to go on the pilgramage.

He goes with master ryleigh . He has a rival warrior elf quaarts who keeps insulting and dirimued shoves him him and as punishment dirimued runs 20 laps. On his first mission his company was wiiped alsmost wiped out. A beast forcesd the surviors to each other to the death, and the winner will be the slave of the beast. Dirimued was forced to fight is teacher ryhleigh. Ryleigh was happy to fight though because he thought diramued was a discrace to the order

Fate remembered when he found the cult, and managed to kill one, but the others cast some sort of spell. Fate blacked out, but then was capured by dr.rominous. Dr rommonious created the mad mage. Dr rommulis collected 5 of the powers, expet for the one held by the stonemen, and one held by one way more powerful then rommolius. He plans to find the other stones that hold the power of Amon, and take the wish for himself and making him more powerful then the sonnerys other creations. He found “slaves” to help fate find the things (probbarly the other party members)

Brinja’s brother Afric trained in magic under sonnery. Afric joined a rebels when luchionus took power. Dr rommoius turned him into a monster. Brinja had her memories of her brother complety erased when she heard the news, at her fathers request. In her memories brinja was forced to fight her brother. Alfred had been turned into a shadowbeast. but because she awakened her memories of ther brother, she was able to bring out the consiousness of her brother to reverse the control of the dreams.

After taking control of the dreams, afric destroys the ancient stoneman, and saves us from the stoneman’s curse. After we talk about the memories we lost. Then we walk to the port town to find conrad cosmic has been burnd and drained his mucles are astofied. He wakes up and yells not to go to sea in a panic. We are escorted out and we go to the docks. We meet

### Session 7

Fate and diarmuid go to the healing hut to help conrad cosmic, and they help traveling mages stablize but he does not awaken. Conrad had his very life takin and his body had been atropfied from his body. Apprently he was damaged by magic from chaos relm alled. Chaos relm is split into layers, the head mage and a dark elf mage that seems to be a lutenient. We leave and go to the docks. We meet with captan weasly thoern, a dawrf who was paid by doctor romanius to take us across the sea. He seems a little slow. After, we go shopping and buy pots, a whip, an antitoxin, and an arcane focus for fate. After shopping, ataxia suggests we split up,

Fate and ingrid went to the bar, fate was guided by the spirit of his mom towards it. After an echange with the barkeep, fate and ingrid went to talk yuaanti the lord of darkness(fromarly shaanti). He bets 4 of his fingers for his moms soul brutel chess match. but before he destroys his mom's soul, he surrenders the game so that both ingrids soul and his mom’s soul arnt destroyed. Yuaanti takes both ingrid’s soul and his mom’s soul then leaves saying the peson who will take his fingers was an old friend of his and to say hi for him. He also says that there is a soul sphere where souls go

Diarmuid goes with lady ataxia and she explains that the crow only watches fate. She has been sending messanger crows to the jagren order, and managed to get lady castora to speak with diarmuid. She explains that the forefather is neather the good nor bad, and created a cycle of reincartion of souls but igonred there suffering. She is from a long lenage that has served the forfater called the hand of the forfather. Her mother Gertrude godwyn , lead the jagron order very violently, and oppressed people. But when the forefather fell still, everyone started targeting him and the order to steal his power. Castora was 16 when she inherited the order, and lead the order down a more peaceful path. She promises to keep tabs on diarmuid and hopes that when romanious revieals his hand, they can use the info to stop his plan in its tracks.

Brynja is dragged out by one of the travelling mages. The mage girl Yona says that she sufferd a bad break up, and wants someone to talk to. Yona and brynya talk in the park. She is a member of the rune schollars. They tavel the world healling the mortally wounded. She says that whatever attacked him damaged the soul it’s self. Where yona says that when rune of her tribe use fusion rings as a form of marriage. Its a permanent fusion that they are able to preform as a combo of their rings and their regenerative abilities. Yona agreed to do the fusion marraige as a child, and now she is being called to preform it so they can heal Conrad cosmic. She isnt ready to give up her individuality. After brynja talks about her love to fight. She talks about the fights. She says fate is cool gentlemanly, and has a crazy pack.he is friendly type. Says that diramuid, who is formal, type but still gentlmenly. She is good with diramuid is good with spells. Yona says that she met a teifling that was able to make a mechanical crossbow that similer to the repeating crossbow that ingird made. After they talk a bit more, one of the mages named Sharyen Yarken, goes to bring Yona back to preform the fusion. Yona runs, and brynja follows and stops Yona from putting on the ring. Sharyen engaeds Bynja in combat. Byyngra is pushed to the brink, but before yona is forced to fuse lady castora shows up and ends the fight.

After the fight, brinja is healed, and told sharyen that she will personally help heal conrad, so yona donst have to fuse. Yona castora and sharyen leave, and diramoud, brynja ataxia catch up with fate. They all explain what happend to one ther way.

The roote head healer leander Harun said There was a cloth found with with the insigna of a rose vallor pirete. When two members fuse that are not of the roote clan, it isnt always disasterous if they are not incompateible. If they are combitble. The fusion will be stable. However, if one of the rings is broken, the the fusin will become unstable and begin uncontrolablely fusing with everything around it.

Right before they begin annouunceing the conditions, vycera walks onto the stage, and stabs ataxia in the throat. While she dies on stage, lord fallstaff explains that this is a ploy by lucianness and his herolds to round up his opposition, and slay them all together. They reviel that the food has been poisened and that the small doses throghout each of the days stacked up enough to be lethal today. While the wayfiars lay cokeing on throught due to posien, they recivie ataxias final words.

He has a antidote to the poisen, and a carage waiting outfront for bryinja and him to escape. Brynja refuses to leave without the other wayfairers, and says that she is compleled by her curse anyways. Just then, the curse compless her to stab leif because of her revelation.
