### Session 1

Start of a speech given by vikkar juun and his wife vikkar adoria, and vikkar forrest

Sabieen doughter of adoria and juun

Lord umbron is a draon born and a herold of Ancan, but there isnt anything about him in the library part of his heroldy is to be able to read and understand books and spells instantly, but it seems he has a limit he can read without rest. He may have the ablity to read people asl w

Shale sorcaon, first bron of the white dragon. She ventures into chaos relm, and has made many innovations inthe school. Uses fire and ice spells, and create life. May be able to boost magiacal ablities

Axel used to be a herold of Ancan, but retired to start a family

Feiyan is a herold of castora, and defender of the cathidreal

Feyali needs to find feiyan. May be a herold of sonnery

Ancan, is pretty lazy but he cast spells to see to see into peoples memories, as well as likes to have sex in his bedroom

Fate visited diramuid to ask about blaidd, he was told that dispite not being that loyal to the order and castora, he has the drive to achive his ideals that is nessarey for a herold to withstand the power they have.

After, he speaks with vikkar forrest and he is ordered to get a parther for the tourniment.

Fate chooses blaadd as a partner, and goes to the trainging grounds to find them. Fate sees blaidd on th floor after an extensive training sesson with briyana. Blaidd agrees to work with fate after he makes him swar not to tell anyone he was having a rough time and looking unsightly. Fate agrees and they pair up for the torniment. They then go to town to get some grapes that diramuid requested, and after a little bartering, the got it. However, on their way back lady lilitina brought us to her sanctuary. She said someone was watching us, and told us to stay untill they stopped. We chatted a bit, inside, and found out that blaidd has a warlock pact with an enitiey(succubas queen, but he didnt reveal that yet). After we leave, we find that the herlold Alabaster is a soulless, and that his master had commaned him to kill Feiyan, a fellow herold of castora, and took his heroldry power. We all took turns interagating him, and when Fate questioned him, it was reveled that his master is mostlikey male, does not sleep with women. The then says its ominus rex,and that he killed feiyan and took the haroldery so that he could get to the legendary artifact when the gaurds wer taking him away, he suddnly had heart attack and died. He then turned to ashes bfore anyone could revive him. With that the tourniment was offcially cancaled and they seaid there would be a mission with 4 man squads instead. After the we were dismissed, lord umbron and blaidd talked about how their father was on his death bed, and that blaidd needed to return to sonneries domain to take over leading the army for his father.

### Sesstion 2

-rominus rex is alive, aswell as feiyan. Vikarr forresst managed fake their deaths. Forrests heroldy allows him to make it seem like his heart stopped.

-rex’s mind is protected by magic, so they torture info from him.

-rex is forrest’s bastard son, but he is a trator apparently.

-rex was hired by sonnery’s herold Argon, blaidd’s father

-Feiyan’s body that was found dead is actually a fake, but the severd arm will be shipped over to sonnery.

-castora awakens and shows everyonethe correct paths

-castora premotes diramuid to vikar

-the blue shard of Aamon, and the memory manipluation powers have been stolen. Fate and lilthina’s memories have been changed by the theif. The theif is someone with the power to see through clairvoyance, and they may have had memorory alteration power powers before stealing the shard. Mages under sonnery have made high level spells that preform meory maniplation, so it may be someone connected to sonnery

-the high confessor, attacked the churge and lead the towns people’s revolt. He is s

A reincarnatier, he is able to rincareate other people by using their body.

-sonnery was a preist of the forefather. He had delutions of grandre, and had the plot to become a bloodbarer. The parasite has likely taken over his mind by now

-there are levels to heroldry. Basic, acendance and sovern. Fate is at basic level. The vikars, are at accendance, and the only confirmed sovern herold is Vycera

### Session 8: fate route

- Fate byrona and Athusa, make their way to the city of vortagurn to ask the barroness for directions to lcuiancss castle. She gives us 500 gold, and rides a dragon to bring us to the capital city of paradisia, where luci liives.
- At the castle, we meet luci and have a talk with him. We also meet Delta keigo, one of his herolds.Then luci leads us around the castile interior. The inside is brimming with magic, and has majestic features. The hue is a pale blue color. He then take us to the corpse of the forfather and we talk there.
- Luci reveals that his mom vecrea was supposed to be the sacred mother, and consort to the forfather, but he fell still before they could wed.
- The relationship between luci and the fallstaffs is strained. The fallstaffs respect him a lot, but also use him as a tool and keep him confied to the castle. He feels very lonely because of that. He wishes he could speak with the forfather, and expriance talking to his real father. He also feels lonely without any friends.
- Luci then treatus to rabbit curry he made himself. While he is cooking, Keigo reveals himself to be a new follower of Aamon, and is looking to collect the shards like Aamon. He hates fate for letting lilthinga die, and demands the dagger from him.
- When fate refesues, he gets hostile but before anything happens, lunch is prepared and they all have to go and eat.
- After lunch, Keigo resumes is request for the dagger, issueing a dual to fate for it. Fate declines, but bryona takes him on the offer wanting a good fight.

- However, instead of coming down, bryona rages one last time, and the sword tries to stop her by self destructiong inside of her. This blowes her to peaces beyond her regenration.
- Waking up inside, fate and athusa dont even get the chance to greave before keigo, demands the dagger agan. Fate agrees to give it if he is allowed one more day with with it (this is so he can get lilithina’s soul that is inside the space dimention, but he doesnt tell keigo that). Keigo agrees and offers to teleport out fate and athusa back to the destiation before the fallstaffs come. They take him up on the offer, but before they can make it to the teleporter, the path is blocked by veycora the new bloodbarer.
- She wounds keigo and takes fate and athusa, leaveing him to die. After, she brings them back the the duealing ground where bryona was killed and uses her power allong with the pecies of bryona left to resurect her into a trion. She also bestows her heroldrey on bryona. Then she askes her to choose between going with her, or staying with us.
- Bryona chooses to go with veyscora, fate turns away, shareing only a few paring words. Athusa goes to try and hug her goodbye, but bryona slapps her away. She has a look of both anger and regret after, but she does not apologize. She simpley turns to follow veycora. Befor ethey leave though, luciaus awakens, and tries to fight veycora again.
- This time the battle is in veycora’s faver due to the close proximity to water, and she seals luci in a fountan the pond of the dualing guardan. She then floods the whole capital city, as retriubton for disregrding the forefather, then leaves.
- Fate and athusa rush back to where keigo is, and find him still alive. We go to the teleporter to try and get away, but keigo has to stay behind to power it with his heroldry. We are teleported away, while keigo fallis into the riseing waters.

### Session 9: blaiedd route

-after using the teleporter, alabaster, bladid and umbron were left in the middle of the tecotten desserd instead of their proper dropp off point. Bliadd fell uncotions for 2 weeks, so the rest were saved by a band of gnomes.

- after awakening, blaidd and co decide to pasd through the valley of death so they can reach the rondeveus in town, and slay a dragon at the request of the gnomes.

-before leaveing blaidd has a peivate convo with his. Patron the future chaos lord of pain. She realinnes his stats and class as thanks for having feiyali kill so many people. He becomes a monk warlock milticlass.

-on the way the way to the valley the team encounters an oaisis brimming with magic

- it is actually a trap laid by athusa to catch pray to eat and she comes and attack blaidd and co.

-after a brief spat, its reveald that she faught and killed feiyali because she killed lilithina. But then she larns yhat the guy she is fighting is the one that is supposed to help her reunite with her other half

- after agreeing to a truce they continue into the valley

- the valley is full of socpipns, dessert monkeies and a dragon at the end

-blaidd wants to test his new skills, so he fights mostly alone and gains new fighti g styles as a result.

- however while fighting the dessert monkeys the dragon is awoken and comes to attack.

- alabaster acts quickly and teleports athusa blaidd and himself to safey.

- after athusa sets up a safe area, lord umbron put everyone to sleep

- before he falls unconscious alabaster senses that he is carrrying the heroldry of feiyan and umbron says he has a dilivery to make

### Session 10: blaiedd route

-we fight the dragon, but then ricakrd shows up and makes us fight each other.

### Session 11: blaiedd route

-athusa’s family was killed by the fallstaffs

-we got trapped in an illuion, and ended up damamged.

-alabaster got crippled

### Session 12: blaiedd route

-did you forget “Code Lambda”

-the protype star farged weapon “starforged precurser” its last user caused a large ammount of destruction, gurturde

-the pilgram dagger has multiple hosts to be its blood barrier. First lars larson, and the second was lady dresmdlda, the third is malthion. He got it by being one of sonnery’s loyal followers, and the first teifling.

-the one who made the pilgraam a hearld

Bliads sibllings

Fay willika- hearld of sonnery. She was betrothed to argon,

Endorses umbron, forcefully withdrew radon.

Lord umbron- harold of ankan, and high mage in his court

Barranet Eckheard- argons right hand, and leads the teifling regiment of the orc army is uncle to labrac

Barron radon- harald of sonnery, child of Fay and argon

Lablrac- child of argon, and served him fight, seeks a good fight. Lablonc is the nefw of kart

Withdraws from the inritance selection

Blaidd revaled his background

Aethusa opened up a little bit about her back story awell

The Pillgrem is guarding the bloodbarer who fused with the starforged precurser gurturede, and siad that we must not allow rickard to get to it.

### Session 13: blaiedd route

-we fight umbron in the battle for the inhritance of argon’s army

-we win, and gain the inheritance.

-alabaster is granted a herold of sonnery by someone else, and against sonnery’s will this may imply that romaius can bestow sonnarian heroldries

- the conditions to accend your herlodry are to etther submit your will completely to the bloodbarer’s will, or to grow in strength untill you can handle the acended power. Someone who achives both unlocks soverncy

-umbron is doctor romaius

### Session 14

- The pilgrem may have time manipulation powers. He was able to call the past aethusa and the current time aethusa to the same spot in chaos relm
- The futere and past affect each other. So changes in the future can affect the past.
- Magic is also a fundiental force that can manuiplate time
- The reason the pilgrem picked aethusa is because she was so insginfcent to the history of the world that there was no effect

-blood barers are parasitic in nature, thus when a hearld takes on their power the lose somthing in eachange. And the more powerful the hearldry accends, the more they give up.

- When sonnery was a high priest was a devout priest. However when he became a bloodbarer, the paracite took over.
- Vycera really was the old sacred mother. She is not a createion of the forefather, instead she was a spawn of chaos realm itself. The forefater thought by marring her, he can join the two realms.
- The ginet corpse that fate saw of the forfather, apprently was not his true body, and that the reall “body” was inside of that statue.
- Vycera was strong enough to drink the forefather blood directly, this resultid in the creation of vampries.
- The vycera’s bith predates concepts of “chaos lords”
- Blaidd consumed his pact partner.
- Blaidd wants a kingdom of true peace, to surpass even paradisia.
- Elciana was the sister of vycera. She wanted to beome the ruler of chaos relm to rival her sister who was making a kingdom earthrealm. But she was weak
- Shale is the daughter of alex, so she is prob the half sister of Fate.

### Session 15 aethusa route

There is a greater contiousness in the universe that is stronger then even the forefather, stated by the end of time pillgrim. They acted brash and weak in the court room to make sure

Fate meets with his father

Ancan is caoustos of castora. But his also even more cautiions of sonnery, so they play the fool for him so they can strike against him with.

Power insecuretiy and concquest are

Fate’s family decends from the first men to use magic and served in the court of the forefathe, they are the harpanger family.

Fate was given the crest of the hapengers by his father. If u want to go to the conservatorium

go to halfling village in Floratian Isles present it to da chief

There were hapnger

The thralls that were made at the bloody banquet were sendt back home in an anttempt to control their office and stations of the nobles around gaia, when they suddenly all died though, war broke out.

Leif is castora’s bother

Arriving in aethusa home in shrundia, sense a powerful being father way in the area.its feels like a mix of celetials fay fiend and undead.There is a centar, and an old man in the area. The centar has a large amount of chaosrealm influance on him.

There has been a castsing of a large spell to create all the plant life and manipulate the teraains

In the north there is a lake, with a small island with a state in the center of the lake.. Sitting by the satuse is is a smoking frog, athusa asked him about the stange crature in the north. They siad that they dont know any otherworldly creatures, but there is a recently arrived resurectied dragon that destoryed the area that we landed in. the runds had to be raised with a spell

### Session 16 aethusa route

- We walk and talk with stixcious and find he had been made a vampire servent of the fallstaffs in e change for the mines.
- They are mining soul stones to heal the thralls of the fallstaffs
- Soul gem healing destoys the soul inside the gem. And the user gets their life span shortend by around 20 years.
- While walking the mines, we hear a scream and stixios tops his tour to attend to buissness
- Aethusa uses commune with nature to to learn: the seedling is far way from this area in the mines, stisiox and one other are near by, and there is a prevelnt undead dra
- Soul gems= life gems are lunimus critals that have a circten property that trap lost souls. The soul stones here are what nuish the shrundia forest above, and with all the mining that is happening the connection is being frayed.
- Derimuied found dead bodies. One is a fall staff thraugh that is from scouting party, and mentions that there is a second party that is comeing. Was killed by bite marks and stab wounds. The bitemarks resemble a dragonborne. Killed a few months ago.

The second body also has bitemarks and they are way more fresh. About a month ago

- We sign a contract with sitxios to geantee our safty in the mines, and to get a shipment of life gems, in exchange for keeping the location of the mines a secret.
- After the contract, we go across a brige, disarm a trap, and get to the crypt where the roots of the seedling were calling,
- The seedling reveals itsself to be the grand treem the progeniter of every seedling that the woodelfs grew, the source of the wood elves themseves, and ershine fallstaff.
- Erishine was a palidan of the forfather along with cornilius fallstaff (he was known as conrad in that time), they were groomed to be the forfathers left and right hands.
- When the forfather fell still, they were tasked with killing those that had taken a drink of the forathers blood. They got most of the trater,s and fought against vycera. Before they could kill her cornious advocated for her to live instead (he was most likely chramed by vycera’s hypo eyes). Erishine and corilius begen fighting. Erishine loses the battle, and conrilius became the first oathbraker palidin. The corpse of erishine become the seed of the the great tree, and the power to slay vampires still resisidesd in him and his seedling

Session 17 aethsa route:  

We went outside the dungeon to long rest

Ofc long rest gets interrupted

It's by one of the heralds of the pilgrim who wants to take aethusas chain breaking ability

We fight and almost die

Diarmuid tells aethusa to run and leave him behind, doing the sacrifice play

Aethusa cries ab it but relents and runs

Before Diarmuid is smited, as usual, he is saved-- this time by a rat

it's stixios

it gives us the opportunity to run away together thanks to Aethusa having a movement speed ability lol

guy tries hunting us down

fails cause we stealth good

almost catches us by story conveniences but sir corrun comes back to drive him into a false direction

corrun drops off stixios to us

stixios asks to be judged and nobody does, aethusa forgives him bc she doesn't wanna be a purely Vengeance driven thing anymore

stixios guides us to a place we can get off of shruundia

we find respite at an abandoned temple and get our long rest

diarmuid and aethusa bond, aethusa thanks him for being willing to die for her, diarmuid says blaidd or fate would have done the same (overcomplimenting)

They get to talking about blaidd, aethusa sings his praises and diarmuid says they share a similar fire in their eyes which made diarmuid pick blaidd in the first place. Diarmuid asks aethusa to not end up like either fate or blaidd and act like a true herald of castora (poor wish) and then says he'll at least settle for a peaceful world if that's her goal, which it seems to be.

they go to sleep and aethusa meets with the pilgrim again and jokingly patronized his choice in heralds and the irony of it, of which he laughs off. He tells aethusa he picked them at random and they can come from anywhere in the timeline. Pilgrim gives her a glimpse of who's out there and reveals the guy who jumped us is from the past and is an archdruid. The vision shows him making a deal with a futuristic looking robot to hunt down aethusa together, and they agree. The robot is from the future where gizzo rules Supreme

we wake up and aethusa tells us her vision and where they plan to jump us. We make our way to the docks and before we get there get stopped by the robot guy in question. With a fat long rest, we absolutely shred the guy, in most part bc diarmuid is cracked with his high auras and big numbers with his new manual. An attack that would have killed him was stopped because he had a shield on his back that protected him from backstabbing (another W for Erick foresight) and then he demolished him.

midfight robot reveals he was modeled after fate and tried to use the data he had on fates memories to mentally crush diarmuid by hitting him with mega insecurity barrage. Diarmuid ez beat that shit bc of wis/cha saves being his highest and the power of friendship.

after death bro tries to perfect cell us and blow us up with him

diarmuid bowser tosses him into a demiplane thing aethusa can apparently make a magic gate for or something

get fucked idiot

session ends

Radon needs to change out the stakes, and he can last 1 minute in vampire form before it becomes unsealable. The people have been bitten but the curse is laying dorment for now.

They want henry and they want to find the corpses of powerful warriors so they can take them to the high confessor and have them reborn for their organization. They say that balidd has a day before he has to deliver henry to them, and they will give extra rewards for info about powerful corpses. Blaidd then loads henry onto the dino little slugger, and starts marching towards kahat.

Blaidd contiuses walking on, and but little slugger gets over taken by cristals and gets sent back to the domain. When he arrives at the spire ruins, they find a crater.

Balidd sees the hammer he made with romious’ soul, but he cant pick it up because he doesn't have soul smith. They find adoria encased in crystal.

- Another classification is classical, ancanian, and contemary. Conempory says that pact magic and bloodbearer magic are the same, and natural magic and chaos magic are different. Ancanin says that chaos and nature are the same because earth realm is in chaos realm, and contemporary magic says that devine magic and warlock magic

This soulles says that the watch dogs are on to him, but still acting nutual.

Ther e will be 2 fallsaffs in attendance for the betrothal ceremony. They will be married to soulless so they can open the valt. The 256 soulles are thought the school, as students facluy and even as watchdogs. Romanius created protosouls to hide the fact that they are soulens, basiclly a thin shell of soul energy to mimic the outside of a soul while still keeping the inside hollow.they are also planning to deliver soul energy to perl. Bliadd gets a list of the people who were replaced by soulless and their current
- We get a packet about the elven mophaogy of souls. Elves have intimate attunement to magic and can use it to designate their souls will go after death including calcifying into soul gems, reincarnating to woodland creatures or fairies, or drow with pact magic will return to whoever they made into a pact with, or calcify into shadow crystal. Bloodbearers also will calcify into soul crystal aka a blood soul crystal. It also tells us that

# Manual: Tale of the Mage Slayer

+4 to cha +2 to dex

--------------------------------------------

Chaosrealm is not going to like this one.

--------------------------------------------

Mysic codex: when Fate sees a spell or spell effect, he can use is reaciton to reord it into his codex. After, if he is targeted targeted by a spell he has recorded, he may use a reaction to ignore its effects for himself.. If he attempts to counter spell any spell that is in the codex, he gains a +10 to the counter spell roll if required. If he has the spell slot nesssary to cast the spell, he may do so once per long rest. Spells he knows are already in the codex.

Reorded spells:

Blink

polymorph

Aganazzar's Scorcher

_Evocation 2_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Target:** A line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide from emanating from you in a direction you choose

**Components:** V, S, M (A red dragon's scale)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A line of roaring flame 30 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**_At Higher Levels_**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

Man of the new ministry:

As a bonus acton fate can activate one of these ablites:

Fate can imbue the powers of amon into his moirai barriers and vice versa.

He can convert 3 moirai bariers into a warlock spell slot, or vice versa

He may store effects of the power of amon into his a recital.

he can use warlock spell slots to charge his moirai bullet 1 slot for 1 action of charge.

When he uses a healing spell, in additon to the target everyone who has as an active moirai shield from sermon regains the same amount of hp.

Passive

Arcane action

Fate gains 1 extra bonus action, and when he casts a spell using his main action he can immediately take the attack action after

Feiya-Li:

Has herold ablity is 10 deaths: unblockable attacks that deals dmage from a bunch of diffrent dmage types. Opponet rolls a luck roll in order to avoid it.

----------------------------------

New stuff:

Mana flow:

Fate integrate fates sorc points, spell slots, and heraldry charges all into one resource unique to him. I got the idea from the spell points optional rule where you represent your spell slots as a single mana bar instead of of having designated slots for each level. 36 points total so that the

we can use the spell points table as normal, but under this system fate can only create up to 5th level spells and any 6th level or higher spells need to be cast with a 6th level slot or other source

for his barriers, we can just say that it takes 6 mana points to create one barrier to keep so that he still only has 6 charges overall.

for his barrier recovery, we can say that he either gets back 6, 12 or 18 mana points on a d3 roll to keep consistent with his current barrier conversion rate of 1 barrier for 6 mana points.

mana flow is the result of Fate now just constantly cycleing his spellslots sorc points and barioer charges, and starts to blur the line between bloodberer ablites and chaos relm magic.
