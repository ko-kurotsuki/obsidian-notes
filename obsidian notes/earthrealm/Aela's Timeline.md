_A loud splash is heard, as Boba Goobo jumps into his pool, then begins to swim in a perfect circle. Jelly-like viscous water is scattered everywhere, somehow right into the bowl of food Kylus was eating from. Kylus rolls his eyes and gets up, dumping the contents of the bowl in the trash. He would shout at the Gruung, but knowing Boba he is going to block out everything not involving doing laps, and he is going to be at it for literally hours. Kylus audibly groans and sits back at the table, taking a swig of ale. It's bad enough they are in another one of Sixto’s dingy hideouts, doing menial jobs just to eat barely passable food, now he can’t even eat that food in peace. The front door violently swings open, and Vastacor alongside Sixto enter, apparently in the middle of a heated argument. They both angrily sit at the other side of the table._

_The Dragonborn shouts out the wirey elf. “Well how the hell was I supposed to know all of the Dwarves went crazy and tried to take over the world! Back in my day Dwarven trinkets were valuable!”_

_Sixto facepalms. “You should have asked before spending half of the earnings from our last haul on that useless Dwarven necklace. It's going to take months to afford a ship at this pace!”_

_Vastacor grumbles a profanity in Draconic under his breath before continuing. “Look, how about you fill us in on what happened the past thousand years or so, so I don't waste another fifty silver buying something that *isn't* valuable. If you would be so kind.”_

_Aela chimes in, startling Kylus, who didn't even know she was in the room with him. “I would love to write you a little timeline to catch you guys up.” She spreads out a parchment, dips her feather into ink, and begins to write._

**Earthrealm Timeline:**

**This begins the Blood Wars, with Lucihannes, The Pilgrim, Sonnery, and Koncosm forming an alliance called The Inheritors to battle this insurrection. To bolster their army, Sonnery creates the Tiefling race, as well as nightmarish creatures such as Mind Flayers and Hags. Lucihannes begins transforming anyone he came across into Shadowbeasts. During this time, Ancan unleashed a raging blizzard, freezing over the continent of Azure, transforming it into the Frozen Wastes. Following this, the Aarakocra appear and guard over the ruins of Estrella.**

**8798: After eight unforgivingly vicious years of war, the final battle of the Blood Wars takes place in Shrundia. The Tieflings betray Sonnery at this battle, and with their help The Iron Armada deals decisive blows to the Inheritors. Koncosm, in a fit of rage, becomes insane and transforms into a hideous abomination, consuming the souls of countless soldiers of the Iron Armada as well as that of her Goliath kin. The Five Divine Knights of Griffenheim, empowered by the holy magic of Castora as well as the sorcery of Ancan seal away all of the Inheritors, as well as their forces into Limbo through a large tree used as a portal. This forest became known as the Forest of Death.**

**8822: Castora achieves enlightenment, transforming her non-Bloodbearer kin into Aasimar. She then spends a day performing various miracles on Earthrealm, before mysteriously vanishing. Other Jagren were able to replicate this feat, creating various saints. Despite once worshiping the Forefather, the Jagren later evolved into their sole worship of Castora and their saints.**

**10653: Aela was born!**

**10672: Symon Sunbringer of the Divine Knights is defeated, and upon his defeat he incinerates the continent of Shrundia in a massive supernova.**

_Vastcor’s eyes widen. “I was really a Shadowbeast for one thousand seven hundred and eighty years?? I called it a thousand year nap as a fucking joke!!”_

_Boba Goobo rises out of the pool, and walks up to the table. The naked two foot frog then grabs the parchment, and begins to dry himself with it. Everyone yells at him, but Boba chuckles to himself because his fishbowl is not on, meaning all their insults sound like gibberish to him. He throws the ruined timeline, and says “Thanks.” in Gruung, before walking away to find something to eat._
