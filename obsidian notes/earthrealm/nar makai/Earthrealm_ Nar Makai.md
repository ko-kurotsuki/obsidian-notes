We started in a dilapidated tavern, Kor harassed the barkeep and took a holy symbol rosery from him. We spoke to the priest and he told us to go to the house of the mad mage to look for more clues about the curse in town. The curse makes people go crazy while they slowly rot, Then they turn into undead.

When we go out into town we see that the town is in ruins and everyone outside is dead. The corpses have signs of rot, but are also struck with radiant damage (prob from them being put down by preists). When we reach the outside of the mad mages old house, we encounter zombies that were buried there. We kill them. We loot them
