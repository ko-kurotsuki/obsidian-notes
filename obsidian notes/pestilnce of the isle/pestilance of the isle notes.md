One of your developers told me that they were supposed to be based off of White Rabbit’s ‘best operative’ and ‘resemble her.’ Is this what you think of me as? Curves? If so, your proportions are way off. They’re much too small if they’re supposed to look like me.”
    - “Venom Asura”: “To R&D. “Yelena wants me to help her reverse engineer that Venom Asura thing we found, see if we can extract whatever Technique it might be hiding.

    - “The Boar”: “To Operations. I think Taowu is after me. Did they find out about that contract? Who was that job even for? I don’t think they like what I might have seen.
