Lexs dad learned the truth that the shinji were sinning from someone friendly (lexs true dad??), but they killed his friend. After that lexes dad failed as many missions as possible, and when they were being turtured. The idea of the expriment is to find the fundament of maserians, the part that desides what kind of kinesses was decided. Lex’s dad gets thrown in jail, but escapes with lex. He was wounded in the escape. Lex’s dad found lex’s true mom and she told him to go as far away as possible.lex is able to puify umbra and make it sinless.
