the king of prophets sends out invites to 4 people he claims to be the hero's that will seal the demon lord.  when the four arrive, he says that they must gain the power of a hero by attempting the 3 shrine trials: trial of strength, trial of renown, and trial of Duty. for safety the location of each shrine has been hidden, but he has seen the path to the first and gives the kings crusaders the direction of the the shrine of renown.  


the shrine of renown is located in the western sea of grass, in the shade of the Lone Tree. 
this shrine is headed by priestess maraka.  maraka tells them that to complete this trial they must climb to the top of the Lone tree and  face the nameless shades as they acend. if they fall to the ground at any point, they can gain the nameless hero title, whitch means their deed and actions will go unnoticed by many, and when they pass, their name will forgotten to history. if they make it to the top of the tree, the gain the famous hero title. people across the land will recognize them and they can have an easier time gaining help from people on their quest.

* the famed hero can get discounts at stores, and free nights at inns 
* the nameless hero is less likely to be targeted by random target npcs if they are chosen filp a coin, if its heads they will roll for a different target.

when they leave, they will be attacked by  sunshi hua. she will fight them, realize they are actually heroes when they bring her to half. she will escape, and report to the demon lord that she has found the new heroes. the demon lord will order her to watch them closely and gain all the info she can about them. 


shrine of Duty is on white fang mountain in the snowdrifts of the north. its headed by priestes zaydra. for this trial, they must search the mountain for the everblooming flower, and bring it back to the priestess. sunhsi hua will over hear this and try and interfere with the trial by sending in lesser demons to destract them while she searches for the flower herself. if they succeed  they get a herbal tea that can increase one of their attributes by a size.  the heroes will gain demon blood tea that can let them gain a resistance but they will be susuptible to greater demon control, and may have to make will saves in order to resist it.
